        <h3>“Our main goal since day one is quality over quantity and each batch is hand made with the best ingredients.”</h3>
        <p>Let’s go back to the beginning, shall we? Way back in 2010, a bright and aspiring patisserie chef started a little cake shop called Treat, near his home in Japan’s northern suburbs. 
          Within just two years, his cakes were so well known that orders outstripped the shop kitchen’s ability to keep up. 
          Spotting a gap he knew he could fill, Jandri Sasuke opened a commercial bakery, and in 2012 The Bakery Co was born.
